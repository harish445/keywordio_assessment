 
Library Management Sysytem using DjangoRestFramework.

. Student can only view the books. So, set the default home to student page and list all the books which is in database.

. create authentication for admin in djangorestframework using libray 'Djoser'. and restricted api endpoints only for admin using permission classes .

. I like to seperate my api views and endpoints, so I created 'api' directory and created files - views.py, models.py, urls.py and serializers.py.

. modified User model so that admin records are unique based on emails and create function based views, serialize data and return serialized data in restframework.

. create endpoints in urls.py. 

create library app -

. Use bootstrap5 library for frontend.
. create Book model with fields name, author and price of the book.
. their is only one view and url for student page.

finally change database from default 'sqllite' to 'mysql'. and migrate database.

-- to register new user go to '/api/users'
-- to generate token - 'api/token/login'

Thanks!
